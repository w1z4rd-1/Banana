### Building AppleSkin
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a command line and execute ```gradlew build```

Note: To give the build a version number, use ```gradlew build -Pversion=<version>``` instead (example: ```gradlew build -Pversion=1.0.0```).

### For Mod Developers

If followed, the directions below will make it so that your mod's Maven dependencies won't include AppleSkin at all, and your mod will load fine with or without AppleSkin installed.

To compile against the AppleSkin API, include the following in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
	maven { url "https://maven.ryanliptak.com/" }
}
```

and add this to your `dependencies` block:

```groovy
modCompileOnly("squeek.appleskin:appleskin-fabric:<version>:api") {
    transitive = false
}
```

where `<version>` is replaced by the appropriate version found here:

https://maven.ryanliptak.com/squeek/appleskin/appleskin-fabric

> *Note: `modCompileOnly` is used for the API module because the AppleSkin API is not distributed as a separate mod (and therefore it is also not recommended to include it as a jar-in-jar)*

Once you're compiling against the AppleSkin API, you can use the `"appleskin"` [entrypoint](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/documentation:entrypoint) to register your event handlers. Here's an example implementation:

In your `fabric.mod.json`:

```json
"entrypoints": {
  "appleskin": [
    "your.package.name.AppleSkinEventHandler"
  ]
}
```
and the `AppleSkinEventHandler` class:
```java
public class AppleSkinEventHandler implements AppleSkinApi
{
	@Override
	public void registerEvents()
	{
		FoodValuesEvent.EVENT.register(foodValuesEvent -> {
			// display hunger restored as 1 for all food
			foodValuesEvent.modifiedFoodValues = new FoodValues(1, foodValuesEvent.defaultFoodValues.saturationModifier);
		});
	}
}
```

(see the `squeek.appleskin.api.event` package for all the possible events that can be registered)

---

Note: if you want to test with the full AppleSkin mod in your development environment, you can also add the following to your `dependencies`:

```groovy
modLocalRuntime("squeek.appleskin:appleskin-fabric:<version>") {
    exclude module: 'modmenu'
}
```

while replacing `<version>` as mentioned above. You will also need to add the Maven repository for Cloth to your `build.gradle`, since AppleSkin depends on it:

```groovy
repositories {
	maven { url "https://maven.shedaniel.me/" }
}
```
